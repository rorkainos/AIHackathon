## Documentation

This project uses MkDocs to generate static documentation. We are using the Material theme for a modern look.

### MkDocs Installation

To install the documentation run the following command:
```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

### Running the Documentation Server

To preview the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```

The documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Building the Documentation

To build the static site:

```bash
cd docs
mkdocs build
```

The built site will be in the `docs/site` directory.

### Deploying the Documentation

Upload the contents of the `docs/site` directory to your web hosting service.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage:
- TODOs are automatically saved as you add/edit/delete them
- Refreshing the page preserves all your data
- Clear your browser's localStorage to reset the app

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Escape:** Close modals and dialogs
- **Enter:** Submit forms (when focused on last input)

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
