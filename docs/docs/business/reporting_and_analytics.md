# Reporting and Analytics

This document summarizes reporting-like capabilities available to users.

## Available reporting (lightweight)

- Calendar View provides a per-day count of TODOs for the visible month.
- Timeline View provides an ordered, grouped view of TODOs by date.
- Each TODO provides a derived urgency indicator based on time remaining.

These features support day-to-day planning and prioritization but are not formal analytics.

## Not available

- No dashboards or productivity metrics.
- No trend analysis over time.
- No export of data.
- No filtering/search beyond scanning the views.

## Freshness expectations

- Counts and groupings update immediately after actions.
- Countdown and urgency indicators update continuously while the app is open.
